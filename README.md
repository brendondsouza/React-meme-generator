# Grocery Buddy

As a meme connoisseur, I knew I wanted to build a pet project that combines two of my favorite things: Memes and React!

**Link to project:** [Meme Generator](https://react-meme-gen-app.netlify.app/)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

I build this meme generator using React. The meme images are being pulled in from an [api](https://imgflip.com/api) that provides the top 100 trending memes. Forms are used to collect the meme text and the state is updated in real time and hence the text appears across the image as soon as the text is entered into the form input. API calls are made when the button is clicked and a new meme image is returned.
